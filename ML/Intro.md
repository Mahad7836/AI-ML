# Machine Learning
## Overview

### Machine Learning (ML) is the field of study that focuses on developing algorithms that enable computers to automatically learn from data and identify hidden patterns — allowing them to make predictions, classify information, or make data-driven decisions without being explicitly programmed.

### Categories of Machine Learning
1. Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves training a model using labeled data — that is, input-output pairs where the correct output is already known.
The algorithm learns the mapping between inputs and outputs, identifying relationships and patterns to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Examples:

Predicting house prices
Classifying emails as spam or not spam

2. Unsupervised Learning

In unsupervised learning, the model is trained on unlabeled data. The goal is to discover hidden structures or patterns within the data without predefined categories or outcomes.

Examples:

Customer segmentation
Anomaly detection
Topic modeling

3. Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) is based on the concept of rewards and penalties. An agent interacts with an environment, learns from feedback (rewards or punishments), and refines its actions to maximize long-term rewards.
This approach is widely used in areas such as game playing and robotics.

Example:
A game AI that learns to reach higher levels or earn special items through experience and reward-based learning
