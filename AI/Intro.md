# Artificial Intelligence

#### Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

These tasks include reasoning, learning, perception, problem-solving, understanding natural language, and decision-making.

AI enables computers and machines to simulate human-like behavior — allowing them to analyze data, adapt to new inputs, and perform tasks intelligently.

### Key Components of Artificial Intelligence

Machine Learning (ML)
AI systems use machine learning to learn from data and improve performance over time without being explicitly programmed.

Deep Learning (DL)
A subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks to model complex patterns in large datasets — commonly applied in image and speech recognition.

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language (e.g., chatbots, translation tools, voice assistants).

Computer Vision
Allows computers to interpret and analyze visual information from the world, such as images and videos.

Robotics
Combines AI with mechanical systems to create intelligent machines capable of performing physical tasks autonomously.

### Applications of Artificial Intelligence

Virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa)
Recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix, YouTube)
Autonomous vehicles
Fraud detection
Healthcare diagnostics
Smart home devices
